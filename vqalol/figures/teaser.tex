        % Illustration of logical composition of questions. 
        State-of-the-art models answer questions from the VQA dataset ($Q_1, Q_2$) correctly, but struggle when asked a logical composition including negation, conjunction, disjunction, and antonyms. 
        We develop a model that improves on this metric substantially, while retaining VQA performance.
